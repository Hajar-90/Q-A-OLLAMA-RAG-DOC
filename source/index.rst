Introduction
-------------
The **Q-A-OLLAMA-RAG-DOC** project combines **Ollama**, a powerful language model, with **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques to answer complex questions and generate useful document-based outputs. The integration of Ollama and RAG enables us to enhance the quality and relevance of answers by leveraging large document collections, such as the ones that can be retrieved using vector databases.

This section outlines the purpose of the project, its key technologies, and the problems it aims to solve.

Technologies Used:
- **Ollama** (Language Model Framework)
- **RAG** (Retrieval Augmented Generation for improved query-response systems)
- **Vector Databases** (for indexing and querying document embeddings)
