# Q-A-OLLAMA-RAG-DOC

**Q-A-OLLAMA-RAG-DOC** is an application that integrates **Ollama** with **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques to enhance document-based querying and response generation. This app allows users to efficiently query a collection of documents and generate relevant answers using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models.

The main goal of this app is to combine document retrieval and language generation techniques to provide accurate, context-aware responses to user queries.

## Key Features

- **Document Retrieval and Question Answering**: Retrieve relevant documents from a collection based on user queries and generate high-quality answers.
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Enhance language models by incorporating a document retrieval mechanism to improve response quality.
- **Support for Multiple Models**: Choose from different NLP models to improve flexibility and performance.
- **Vector Database Integration**: Efficiently store document embeddings and enable similarity-based document retrieval.
- **Custom Query Interface**: Interact with the system through a custom-built interface, whether command-line or web-based.
- **Dynamic Model Switching**: Dynamically switch between multiple models for optimal performance.
